                <p> Hey! I'm Momina, the person behind this blog. I am a beginner web developer documenting my 
                progress as I learn about HTML, CSS, and more! </p>
                <p>I started this blog to track my progress, 
                share what I learn, and hopefully help others who are also beginning their web development journey. 
                Writing about my experiences keeps me accountable and motivated to keep pushing forward, even when things get challenging. 
                Expect posts about my experiences, challenges, and projects! </p>
