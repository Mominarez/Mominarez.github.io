      <h2>Commitment, Pure Learning and Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past week or so, I've immersed myself in learning both CSS and
        JavaScript with a focus on building user friendly login interfaces. This
        rapid dive into front-end development has been both challenging and
        rewarding, pushing me to explore how styling can completely transform
        the look and feel of a website.
      </p>

      <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
      <p>
        <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets (CSS) is the language used
        to style web pages. It allows you to change fonts, colors, sizes,
        spacing, backgrounds, borders, and even add animations! All without
        altering the underlying HTML structure. This separation of content and
        presentation is one of the key strengths of modern web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some key insights I gained about CSS were from

            target="_blank"
          >
            MDN Web Docs - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</a
          > </i
        >. The MDN documentation not only clarified the core concepts of CSS but
        also highlighted how the "cascading" nature of styles allows for
        flexible and maintainable design. By learning about selectors,
        properties, and the box model on MDN, I was able to appreciate how small
        changes in CSS can have a large impact on the overall visual experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Integrating CSS with JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        After a brief review of HTML fundamentals, I shifted my focus to
        intertwining CSS with JavaScript by watching educational youtube videos
        online. Building simple login forms was my first step. Through this
        hands on approach, I learned that while CSS is responsible for the
        visual styling, JavaScript can make things interactive and respond to
        what users do on the page. This combination is very important for modern
        web applications.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Learned and What's Next</h2>
      <p>
        Focusing on CSS and JavaScript together has opened my eyes to the
        potential of front-end development. While I already had some knowledge
        of CSS basics thanks to MDN Web Docs, diving deeper into building
        functional components like login forms has motivated me to expand my
        skills through self-learning. To further my knowledge, I'm currently
        exploring JavaScript more extensively through LinkedIn's interactive
        courses, where I can follow along and earn certifications as I go. In
        addition, I'm taking an Intro to Web Development class at college while
        doing my best to stay ahead and understand web development at a deeper
        level. I'm very excited to tackle more complex layouts, master
        responsive design, and eventually work on projects that not only look
        great but also function seamlessly; especially while working on this
        website!
      </p>

      <p>
        My progress so far has given me some understanding on how to create
        visually engaging and maintainable web experiences. With the clear
        guidance provided by resources like MDN Web Docs, LinkedIn learning, and
        Scrimba (which is a website my professor instructed us to use). I feel
        inspired to continue exploring and building more creative web pages.
        Thank you for reading!
