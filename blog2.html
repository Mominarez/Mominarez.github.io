        <h2>Exploring the Web: Neocities</h2>

        <p>Hey everyone! It's been a minute since my last post, but I'm back, and I'm really excited to talk about something I've discovered a while ago...<a href="https://neocities.org/browse" target="_blank" class="link-change">Neocities! </a></p>

        <p>Neocities is a platform I found on Tumblr. It allows anyone to create their own personal websites. It's an excellent platform for beginners, 
          which is the reason I decided to create a blog about it!</p>

        <p>If you're interested in web development and don't know exactly where to start, I think Neocities would be a great approach for newcomers to jump in
           and code without being overwhelmed with complex features or tools.</p>

        <p>I haven't exactly used it when I started my learning process. I decided to just hop in and use Visual Studio since I have used different IDEs for projects
           in C++ and Java. However, I think if I were to start fresh, Neocities would be an amazing platform for me.</p>

        <p>The platform seems to provide a clean and intuitive interface that allows beginners to quickly start building their websites, and you don't need 
          advanced knowledge of any complicated software.</p>

        <p>The site lets you edit HTML and CSS directly in the browser! You can immediately see the changes you make in real time, similar to a live server 
          on Visual Studio Code. This simplicity is perfect for users who just started out with web development.</p>

        <p>And since Neocities is centered around basic web development skills, focusing on two core languages: HTML and CSS. it provides a solid foundation for
           learning without getting distracted by more advanced concepts.</p>

        <p>One of the most exciting things I discovered about Neocities is the community of creators who are so passionate about keeping the spirit of the old 
          web alive. Different users share their websites, blog posts, and creative projects, which often incorporate images and gifs to decorate their pages in
           early 2000s internet vibes.</p>

        <p>I found a lot of inspiration in browsing these sites and seeing how others express their personalities and ideas through simple HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>I thought most of these web pages would just incorporate simple web blogs. However, there's a HUGE variety of projects on Neocities. One particularly
           fun find was a chatbot called Naomi Chatbot. <a href="https://jennahiveswap.neocities.org/naomi-chatbot" target="_blank" class="link-change">Click here to check it out!</a> </p>
           <p> Users on this web page can interact with an AI character, and it's a great example of how creative coders can turn even basic tools into interactive experiences.</p>

        <p>Another website I discovered was <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/" target="_blank" class="link-change">Sadgrl</a>. It's a Neocities site that provides a wealth of resources 
          for new web developers. The creator of this site has many assets for those looking to start building their own websites, offering tutorials, links to useful coding 
          resources, and even pre-designed layouts. What's even more refreshing to see is how this site fosters a sense of community by encouraging people to share their 
          knowledge and help one another out.</p>

        <p>If you're a beginner in web development, I highly recommend checking out Neocities. It's an incredible space full of creativity and inspiration, and a perfect
           place to practice your coding skills!</p>
        
           <h2>What's Next for This Site</h2>
           <p>It's been a little while since my last post, and I wanted to briefly explain my hiatus. Between midterms, diving into JavaScript projects, and actually learning JavaScript itself,
             I've had my hands full. On top of that, some other things in my life took my attention away from the site, but I'm really trying to stay consistent and keep improving little by little.</p>
           
           <p>That being said, I'm excited to share that I'm working on adding a projects section to this site soon! It'll be a place where I can showcase what I'm working on outside of this website and give a little
             insight into my web development learning. I'm also exploring ways to make this site more interesting and engaging, so stay tuned for some updates in the future!</p>
           
             <p> I also signed up for my first ever hackathon and I am SOOO excited to experience something new even though its a bit intimidating! I'm really trying to learn what I can before then and hopefully
              be able to apply it for the competition. 
             </p>
           <p>Thanks for reading, and I'm looking forward to sharing more soon!</p>
